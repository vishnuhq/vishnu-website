  fullBio: `I've always been the kind of person who likes understanding how things work. Not just using them, but pulling them apart mentally and figuring out what makes them tick. I enjoy the process of starting with something unclear and slowly shaping it into something structured and dependable. There's something satisfying about turning confusion into clarity and seeing a messy idea become something stable. I like when logic flows naturally and when the end result feels intentional rather than accidental.

What matters most to me is doing things properly. I like code that reads cleanly, decisions that still make sense months later, and systems that behave the way they're supposed to. I care about the small details because they usually surface later if ignored. I'm not interested in quick fixes that only work once. I would rather take the extra time to build something solid and understandable. I'm trying to become the kind of engineer who builds things that last and can be trusted, someone who values consistency, responsibility, and quiet competence over noise.

Teaching changed how I think about my own work. When you spend enough time helping others untangle problems, you start writing code that doesn't need untangling in the first place. It taught me that clarity doesn't happen by accident and that what feels obvious to you is rarely obvious to someone else. It made me more intentional about clarity, not just in what I build, but in how I communicate and collaborate.

Outside the IDE, I enjoy solving the Rubik's Cube (sub-20 seconds!), portrait photography, and watching a lot of thriller films and series.`,
